This workshop is a showcase for how Generative AI in the form of generative Large Language Models (showcasing GPT-4 here via ChatGPT from OpenAI) can be used in the building of a workshop about the the potential of AI. Text and code were adapted from responses of GPT-4 to showcase its capabilities. Also, this workshop aims at showing that AI is far more then Generative LLMs.
